Logged into lnxsrv07, typed in:

(gdb) ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-25.2/

which did absolutely nothing, since that wasnâ€™t a valid command. I then tried:

gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2r -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 - 1844255039))'

which got me a giant block of text, not any readable assembly code. I eventually realized that I needed to set the breakpoint, like so:

gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2
break Ftimes
r -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'

To trace it, I used:

gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2
break Ftimes
set logging on trace.tr
set disassemble-next-line on
r -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'

I then examined the code using si (to proceed through the instructions) and info registers (to see what was in each register at the time), as well as x [memoryaddress] (to check to see if the value at a memory address was being altered.

Then I realized that I had run the wrong multiplication through, so I redid it using the correct command.

r -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
