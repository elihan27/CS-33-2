A.

The formula for the location of array element A[i][j][k] is:

L* ( S*T*i + T*j + k ) + A



B.

R = 7
S = 5
T = 13


If we examine the assembly code of store_ele, then:
1	
2	rax = 3j
3	rax = j + 12j
4	j = i
5	j = j << 6 (or j*64)
6	i = i + j
7	i = rax + i	   
8	k = k + i
9	rax = 8k + A
10 	*dest = rax

The computed memory address in line 10 is 8k+A, which, working backwards, can be found to equal 8(k+13j+65i + A.  We can solve for T, looking at the coefficient for j, which then allows us to solve for S (since T*S = 65).  We can look at the size of the array (which, in line 11, is shown to be 3640), and set that equal to R*S*T to solve for R.
